2,2020-02-04 12.33.18.txt,4,4,4,4,4,I can see an issue here with mixing increase and decrease took few seconds to understand the what was going on and later started to doubt if I understood the scales correctly.

27,2020-02-10 20.55.53.txt,5,4,3,4,4,Keeping in line with the second type this still resembles a clock face but also does away with the complicated look of the second type. It does however confuse to use the same axis for both am and pm even if they are separated in the middle. Colors that differ a lot is a necessity here.,male,21,master,trackpad

36,2020-02-11 14.25.30.txt,5,3,3,5,4,The meaning of the height of each bar is unclear since the radial axis isn't labeled or marked with any numbers. Although this representation is quite intuitive timewise I find the growth in opposite direction more difficult to compare than when the bars grow in the same direction. ,female,24,master,mouse

40,2020-02-11 18.56.42.txt,5,4,3,5,3,A bit easier than the previous representation due to a more clear distinction between am and pm but still not enough as in the first representation. To summarize I think they have their use cases. While comparison at certain times is easier in the 2nd and 3rd representations I found the first one the easiest to use.

43,2020-02-12 04.05.08.txt,2,2,2,2,2,If the AM and PM times are asymmetrically represented a bias will be introduced in how the data are interpreted. PM values will most likely be interpreted higher than AM values.,male,28,master,mouse
