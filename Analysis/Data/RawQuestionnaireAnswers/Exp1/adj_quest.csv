2,2020-02-04 12.33.18.txt,5,4,4,5,5,Maybe most natural visualization of these. Comparing totals maybe harder than with others (instead of summing the totals and then comparing AM and PM you make multiple pairwise comparisons). Easiest to compare specific AM and PM times. As a general comment I felt the questions regarding the most similar or different values bit difficult as at few occasions I wasn't sure should I answer based on absolute or relative difference. ;),male,36,phd,mouse

5,2020-02-04 19.45.55.txt,4,2,2,2,2,It was very difficult comparing two time periods with each other. Thankfully the buttons to the right visualized what I had to compare when I clicked them. This was the first one I tried so I found that it took more time than the others. So the time spent I'd say is more due to a lack of urgency and not being used to the test than it being more difficult to use.,none,29,master,mouse

17,2020-02-05 16.54.58.txt,4,4,4,4,4,"Easier than the other vizs to compare AM-values with PM-values. Easy to find the value for a certain time. Slightly difficult to compare total values across multiple time slots e.g. compare the total value between 1-3 AM and 5-9 PM. This is because time slots adjacent in time (1 2 3 AM) are not adjacent in the visualisation as there are PM-values in between. Nonetheless I did not find this limitation very strong. I do not think much of time in terms of AM and PM but rather my ""mental clock"" goes from 00:00 to 23:59. So I have a preference for the last visualisation with respect to the presentation of time. NOTE: In most of this test I used the trackpad but towards the middle (so around visualisation 2 I think) I used the touch screen and then reverted to trackpad. Sorry!!",male,29,master,touch

In the beginning I had to check the middle circle to remember that am was blue and pm was orange. I think this representation was in general the hardest to answer the questions. With that said it was quite easy to see at what time the values were most similar in this representation and the last representation,male,29,master,trackpad
