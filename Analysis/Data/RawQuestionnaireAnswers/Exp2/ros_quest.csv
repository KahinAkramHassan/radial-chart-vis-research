1,2020-03-03 08.25.07.txt,5,4,2,1,2,"I missinterpeded what the times meant if 8AM meant the ""pie-slize"" between 7-8 or 8-9. It din't become obvious untill the later stage of the questions where the task was to ""find the largest"" and you would choose graphically and the numerical value was not what i had expected. Also the values should be a little transparent so you can read the gradings behind.",male,38,bachelor,mouse
2,2020-03-03 08.59.16.txt,4,3,4,1,4,Easy to compare between different times and harder to compare between am and pm. Also how the hell is having the data before the time stamp in any way an intuitive way of showing time data? Pretty sure that I am of by one hour on every answer.,male,34,phd,mouse
3,2020-03-03 10.53.26.txt,4,3,4,4,5,At beginning had to think which slice is 1 and which 12 but there was a quick learning effect.  Good for comparison of same hour am and pm. Felt best for assessing total range value,female,39,phd,mouse

6,2020-03-05 09.02.08.txt,5,4,5,5,5,This is by far my favourite structure and surprisingly easy to follow. The only issue is how the numbers 1-12 is placed which made the decision of finding the right time a bit harder I always wanted to choose for example the time-pie for 5 if looking for the time-pie of 4. In those questions I think the placement of the numbers were harder for me personally to get the hang of however I understand why they must be placed like that and it's still my personal favourite.,female,27,bachelor,trackpad

16,2020-03-06 22.20.55.txt,1,1,1,1,1,Do you really need to test this? I guess you want to have some data for your paper but in the end is it not obvious that this is a bad way to represent data if you want people to compare values or single out outliers etc?  I got progressively more irritated during the test but stayed to the end just in hope of writing a comment. A classic line graph would show this data much better for comparing values. I have a really hard time trying to think of a use case.,male,44,master,mouse

Only positive I found in this visual representation was that the questions regarding ""which range of times has the highest/lowest value"" was easier to determine since this representation displays values as ""areas"" and it is easy to compare visually which area is the biggest/smallest rather than trying to add up columns.",female,26,master,trackpad

49,2020-03-19 11.34.17.txt,4,4,4,2,3,"Not really the most intuitive way to represent hour since it differs from the classic clock layout. However with some everyday exposure I believe it to be quite easy to pick up. Very hard to find similarities and dissimilarities between the pairs such as: ""what hours are the most similar"". This was made harder if the hours with similar ratios were far from each other. However it was easier to find similarities/dissimilarities with this representation than the second representation  IF the similar valued pairs we're close to each other.
