16,2020-03-06 22.20.55.txt,1,1,1,1,1,Do you really need to test this? I guess you want to have some data for your paper but in the end is it not obvious that this is a bad way to represent data if you want people to compare values or single out outliers etc?  I got progressively more irritated during the test but stayed to the end just in hope of writing a comment. A classic line graph would show this data much better for comparing values. I have a really hard time trying to think of a use case.,male,44,master,mouse

29,2020-03-16 10.12.40.txt,4,5,4,5,5,Easy to understand since the mapping to a clock makes it intuitive. A bit confusing in the beginning that the colors are sometimes AM in front and sometimes PM which I discovered now afterwards is depending on the highest value that is always in the back to allow to see them both. Easy to compare between AM and PM.,female,26,master,trackpad

49,2020-03-19 11.34.17.txt,3,4,4,4,3,"It was good for comparing the values between the same or adjacent hours especially questions like ""Which values are the most similar"". But the representation made it harder to find specific values such as ""What hour across both AM and PM has the lowest value"". I found it harder to distinguish between AM and PM always having to take a second look which color was related to which. Especially since they did change places depending on the value.",male,34,bachelor,mouse
50,2020-03-20 14.42.48.txt,3,3,2,4,3,It took me a while to figure out that the AM and PM were not statically placed i.e. that AM wasn't always in the front. When AM and PM had similar lengths it was more difficult to select the element laying behind the other element. I also found it confusing to compare lengths of the bars between different times. Perhaps make each bar more narrow and put them more next to each other rather than on top of each other if possible. I only felt like I could understand and take in the information about a bar if I had it selected to further extrude it from its surroundings. I did not feel that same way about any of the other visualisations. ,female,22,bachelor,mouse
